This class was created based off the constructs:
  Single port connection through a socket.
    Expanding the idea further
      Take a list of ports or use default list
      Create a list of IP addresses from a cidr range using ipaddress module
      Adding concurrency using concurrency module
      
After iterations of execution testing and identifying where errors were based on OS or code
The AI produced a semi-legitimate version which still required the human element to review and edit the code
  The final fault was the a single location which needed to be wrappend in str()
  
The class creatred is pretty quick and I am sure it could be faster in C like languages, go - whatever your choice
I believe there is still some additional features which could be added like a scapy module to syn scan.
