It seems you are in an environment where installing Python packages system-wide is restricted. You can resolve this by using a virtual environment. Hereâ€™s how you can do it:

1. Create a working environment:
- apt install ffmpeg python3-venv
- python3 -m venv myenv

2. Activate the virtual environment:
- On Linux or macOS:
  - source myenv/bin/activate
- On Windows:
  - myenv\Scripts\activate

3. Install pytube and other dependencies in the virtual environment:
- pip install git+https://github.com/pytube/pytube
- pip install pydub mutagen

4. Execute the script
- python3 utube2mp3.py <video address> <local path>
