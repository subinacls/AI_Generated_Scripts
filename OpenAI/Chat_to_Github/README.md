    popup.html
    popup.js
    upload_to_github.js

  Add icons: 
  
      Create the necessary icons for your extension (icon16.png, icon48.png, and icon128.png) and place them in the extension folder.

  Load the extension in your browser:

      Open Chrome and go to chrome://extensions/.
      Enable "Developer mode" by toggling the switch in the top-right corner.
      Click the "Load unpacked" button and select the folder containing your extension files.


    For Mozilla Firefox:
      Open Firefox and go to about:debugging#/runtime/this-firefox.
      Click "Load Temporary Add-onâ€¦" and select any file (e.g., manifest.json) in your extension folder.

  Use the extension:

    Click on the extension icon in your browser's toolbar. A popup will appear.
    Enter the desired name for your private GitHub repository in the text input field.
    Click the "Upload Python Code" button. 
      
    The extension will attempt to create a new private repository with the given name and upload the generated Python code from the chat.

Please note that this extension requires access to the GitHub API, and you may need to register a new OAuth application on GitHub for authentication. This will provide you with a client_id and client_secret, which you can use to obtain the user's access token. More information on this process can be found in the GitHub OAuth documentation.
